# Category 6 — DB & Hosting

**Status:** ✅ Fully documented (extra-detailed) · **Last verified against live DB + config:** 2026-06-12
**Owner:** Michael Bernard · **Supabase project:** `pdlkkfedovssaaecemkp`

The infrastructure substrate: the Postgres database (schema, RLS, functions, triggers), and where/how the app runs (Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext, build, deploy, secrets). Category 1 owns the *meaning* of the tables; this category owns the *platform they sit on*.

> Verified directly against the live Supabase project and the repo config on 2026-06-12 — including details **not** previously in HANDOVER (a third table + a revenue subsystem, see §3.3 / §5).

## 1. Topology at a glance

| Piece | Host | URL / id |
|-------|------|----------|
| App (Next.js) | **Cloudflare Workers** (via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`) | `https://auto-marker.bernardmanne3.workers.dev` |
| DB + Auth | **Supabase** | project `pdlkkfedovssaaecemkp` (`…supabase.co`) |
| Landing site | **GitHub Pages** (separate repo `DAMiC3/automark-site`) | `https://damic3.github.io/automark-site/` |
| Old deploy | **Netlify** — paused (credits exhausted), config still in repo | ignore |

---

## 2. Supabase project facts
- **Project ref:** `pdlkkfedovssaaecemkp`
- **Postgres extensions installed:** `plpgsql 1.0`, `pgcrypto 1.3`, `uuid-ossp 1.1`, `pg_graphql 1.5.11`, `pg_stat_statements 1.11`, `supabase_vault 0.3.1` (the default Supabase set — nothing exotic).
- **Migration approach:** changes are applied **directly to the remote project** (via the Supabase SQL editor or MCP `apply_migration`). **There are no migration files in the repo** — the DB schema is not version-controlled in git. *(This doc + Category 1 are effectively the schema's source of truth.)*

---

## 3. Schema — four tables (all in `public`, all RLS-enabled)

### 3.1 `profiles` (4 rows) — the customer table
PK `id uuid` → FK `auth.users(id)`. Columns + the bits that matter at the DB level:
- `plan text` default `'none'` with a **CHECK constraint**: `plan IN ('none','trial','standard','pro')` — the DB enforces the plan vocabulary; an invalid plan write is rejected.
- `allowance_cap_zar numeric` default `0`, `used_zar numeric` default `0`.
- `period_start`, `period_end timestamptz` (nullable).
- `full_name`/`subject text` default `''`, `created_at timestamptz` default `now()`.

> Full column semantics → **Category 1 §2.1**. The CHECK constraint is the new detail: it's a second guard rail behind `set_plan`.

### 3.2 `usage_events` (18 rows) — the audit log
PK `id bigint` **identity ALWAYS** (auto), FK `user_id → auth.users(id)`. `papers int` default 1, `model_tier text` default `'standard'`, `cost_zar numeric` default 0, `file_name text` nullable, `created_at` default `now()`. Append-only; written by `add_usage`. → **Category 1 §2.2**.

### 3.3 `revenue_events` (0 rows) — ⚠️ the revenue ledger (undocumented until now)
**This table exists and is wired with triggers, but was not in HANDOVER and was listed as "not built" in Category 1.** Columns:
`id bigint` (identity), `user_id uuid` (FK, nullable), `email text`, `plan text`, `previous_plan text`, `amount_zar numeric` default 0, `event_type text`, `created_at` default `now()`.

It is populated **automatically by triggers** on `profiles` (§5.2) whenever someone moves onto/renews a **paid** plan. It's empty today only because no non-owner paid-plan transition has happened since the triggers were installed (the one paid profile — the owner — predates them, and trigger logging is not retroactive).

### 3.4 `trial_claims` (P1-7, added 2026-06-15) — one-trial-per-email ledger
`email text` PK, `user_id uuid` (nullable), `claimed_at timestamptz` default `now()`. **RLS enabled, zero policies** (service-role / `SECURITY DEFINER` only — like `revenue_events`). Keyed by **email**, not profile id, so it survives account deletion → a deleted-and-recreated account cannot claim a second free trial. Written/checked exclusively by `set_plan` when granting a `'trial'`. → **Category 1 §4.1 / P1-7**.

---

## 4. RLS model
- **`profiles`** — one policy `profiles_select_own`: `SELECT` for `authenticated` where `auth.uid() = id`.
- **`usage_events`** — one policy `usage_select_own`: `SELECT` for `authenticated` where `auth.uid() = user_id`.
- **`revenue_events`** — **RLS enabled, zero policies** → no `authenticated` user can read it at all. Only the **service-role key** (which bypasses RLS) can. Correct for sensitive revenue data.
- **All writes** to every table go through `SECURITY DEFINER` functions called with the **service-role key** server-side. The client has **no write path** to any table; it can only read its own `profiles`/`usage_events` rows. This is the security spine of the metering system.

---

## 5. Functions & triggers (the full inventory)

### 5.1 Core metering (documented in Category 1 §4)
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `handle_new_user()` | Trigger `on_auth_user_created` on `auth.users` INSERT → creates the `profiles` row (defaults → R0/none). |
| `set_plan(p_user, p_plan)` | Assign/renew a plan; resets `used_zar`, sets cap + period (trial 7d/R50, standard 30d/R300, pro 30d/R1500). **Enforces one trial per email** via `trial_claims` (P1-7). |
| `add_usage(p_user, p_cost, p_papers, p_tier, p_file)` | Append a `usage_events` row + increment `profiles.used_zar`. |

### 5.2 Revenue logging (single-trigger as of 2026-06-15)
| Object | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `plan_price(p_plan)` | `IMMUTABLE` helper: standard→1000, pro→3000, else 0. |
| `log_revenue_event()` | **The one revenue logger.** Trigger fn: on paid-plan INSERT/UPDATE, inserts a `revenue_events` row using `plan_price()`. **Excludes the owner** (`bernardmanne3@gmail.com`). Classifies `new`/`renewal`/`change`. Sets `search_path`. |

**Triggers on `profiles`:**
- `trg_log_revenue_insert` → `log_revenue_event` (INSERT, paid plans)
- `trg_log_revenue_update` → `log_revenue_event` (UPDATE, when `plan`/`period_start` changes)

> ✅ **Duplicate-revenue bug FIXED (2026-06-15, P1-1/P6-1).** The older overlapping `log_plan_revenue()` + its `trg_log_plan_revenue` trigger were **dropped** (migration `drop_duplicate_revenue_trigger`). They had hardcoded amounts, did **not** exclude the owner, and didn't set `search_path`. `revenue_events` was empty, so no data reconciliation was needed. Only `log_revenue_event` remains.

---

## 6. Hosting — Cloudflare Workers (via OpenNext)

`wrangler.jsonc`:
- **`main`: `.open-next/worker.js`** — the OpenNext-compiled Worker.
- **`compatibility_date`: `2025-05-01`**, **flags:** `nodejs_compat`, `global_fetch_strictly_public`.
- **`assets`** — served from `.open-next/assets`, binding `ASSETS`, `run_worker_first: true` (the Worker handles routing first, then static assets).
- **`observability.enabled`: `true`** — Cloudflare Workers logs/analytics **are** retained in the CF dashboard. *(This refines Category 4: live tail + dashboard logs exist; what's missing is external aggregation, search, and alerting — not all logging.)*
- **`vars`** (public, committed): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. The anon key being in the repo is **fine by design** — it's the public key, gated by RLS. The **service-role key is NOT here** (it's a Worker secret).

---

## 7. Build & deploy (manual)

The repo is **not** wired to Cloudflare Workers Builds — deploys are manual from the local machine.

`package.json` scripts: `dev` (`next dev`), `build` (`next build`), **`build:cf`** (`opennextjs-cloudflare build`), `preview:cf`, `lint`.

**Deploy sequence** (from `AGENTS.md`, because OpenNext's own deploy fails on Windows):
```bash
rm -rf .next .open-next
npm run build:cf
mv open-next.config.ts open-next.config.ts.bak   # hide it so plain wrangler deploy works
npx wrangler deploy
mv open-next.config.ts.bak open-next.config.ts
```
`open-next.config.ts` is a bare `defineCloudflareConfig({})`; `next.config.ts` is empty defaults. The hide-config dance exists purely to dodge a Windows-specific OpenNext deploy failure — plain `wrangler deploy` uploads `.open-next/worker.js` cleanly.

**Restore point:** git tag `v1.0-stable` at commit `d7161fb`. Hard rollback: `git reset --hard v1.0-stable`.

## 8. Secrets & environment

| Name | Where it lives | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `wrangler.jsonc` vars (public) | safe to commit |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `wrangler.jsonc` vars (public) | safe (RLS-gated) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **Worker secret** (`wrangler secret put`) | never committed |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Worker secret** | never committed; bypasses RLS |
| Local dev keys | `.env.local` (gitignored) | — |

> ⚠️ **Agent-shell gotcha:** the Claude Code agent shell sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` (empty), and Next.js won't override an existing env var — so `.env.local`'s key is ignored when `npm run dev` starts from this shell. Fix: `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY && npm run dev`. End-user terminals don't hit this.

---

## 9. Stack pins & platform constraints (do not bump blindly)

- **Next.js `15.5.18` — NOT 16.** `@opennextjs/cloudflare` can't render Next 16 pages yet (`TypeError: components.ComponentMod.handler is not a function`). React `19.2.4`, Tailwind v4, TypeScript 5.
- **Edge middleware in `middleware.ts`** — *not* Next 16's `proxy.ts`. OpenNext only supports edge middleware. (Behaviour → Category 7.)
- **OpenNext `@opennextjs/cloudflare ^1.19.11`**, **wrangler `^4.95.0`**.
- **Netlify (`netlify.toml`)** still in the repo (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, publish `.next`) but the deploy is **paused** — ignore it. It's a fallback path if Cloudflare ever becomes painful (the HANDOVER notes a possible future Vercel migration once paying customers exist).

---

## 10. Dependencies of note
- **`mammoth ^1.12.0`** is a declared dependency (a `.docx` → text/HTML parser) but is **imported nowhere in source** (grep-confirmed; only in `package.json`/lockfile). It's aspirational — intended for `.docx` memo/answer parsing, matching the dead `UploadZone` `.docx` accept (Cat 3 §5.6). **Either wire it up or drop it.**
- Runtime deps are lean: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@supabase/ssr` + `@supabase/supabase-js`, `pdf-lib`, `pdfjs-dist`, `next`, `react`/`react-dom`.

---

## 11. Known gaps & issues (DB & hosting)

- ✅ **Duplicate revenue triggers — FIXED (2026-06-15, §5.2).** Dropped `log_plan_revenue` + trigger; only `log_revenue_event` remains.
- **Schema now partly in VCS** — D1 buffer schema lives at `db/d1/pending_usage.sql`; Supabase migrations are applied via the Supabase migration tool (e.g. `drop_duplicate_revenue_trigger`) but still not exported as files in-repo.
- **Schema not in version control** — no migration files in the repo; the DB drifts independently of git. Consider exporting migrations so the schema is reproducible.
- **No connection pooling configured** — each Worker request opens its own Supabase connection. Fine now (4 users); needs Supabase PgBouncer/pooling at scale (expansion plan Phase 3).
- **Manual deploy, no CI/CD** — the hide-config wrangler dance is error-prone; wiring Cloudflare Workers Builds (or Vercel) is a future step.
- **Single region, no SA data residency** — Cloudflare has no in-country PoP that keeps data in ZA; an institutional POPIA requirement would force an architecture change (expansion plan Phase 4).
- **`mammoth` unused** (§10).

---

## 12. Invariants — do not break these
1. **Only service-role functions write to the tables.** Never add a client-side write path; RLS has no write policies on purpose.
2. **`revenue_events` stays policy-less** (service-role read only) — it's financial data.
3. **Don't bump Next past 15.x** without re-reading the OpenNext constraint (§9).
4. **Service-role / Anthropic keys are Worker secrets, never repo vars.**
5. **The `plan` CHECK constraint and `set_plan` must agree** — adding a plan tier needs both updated.
6. **Resolve the duplicate revenue triggers before the first real paid customer** or the ledger starts wrong.

## Problems / To-Fix Backlog

> Severity: 🔴 fix before real paying customers · 🟠 important · 🟡 minor/polish · 🔵 not-built/roadmap. Items marked *(advisor NNNN)* are from Supabase's own database linter (run 2026-06-12).

| ID | Sev | Problem | Fix direction |
|----|-----|---------|---------------|
| ~~**P6-1**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-15).** Duplicate revenue triggers — `log_plan_revenue` + trigger dropped (migration `drop_duplicate_revenue_trigger`); only `log_revenue_event` remains. (= P1-1) | Done. |
| **P6-2** | 🔴 | **Trigger functions are publicly callable** *(advisor 0028/0029)* — `log_revenue_event()` is `SECURITY DEFINER` and **executable by `anon` and `authenticated`** via `/rest/v1/rpc/…`. Trigger functions should never be directly invocable. (`log_plan_revenue` is gone, so one fewer.) | `REVOKE EXECUTE … FROM anon, authenticated` on `log_revenue_event` (and any other trigger fns). |
| **P6-3** | 🟠 | **Mutable `search_path`** *(advisor 0011)* — now only on `plan_price` (`log_plan_revenue` dropped 2026-06-15 cleared the other). | `ALTER FUNCTION public.plan_price SET search_path = public`. |
| **P6-4** | 🟠 | **GraphQL schema exposure** *(advisor 0027)* — `profiles` and `usage_events` are discoverable by any `authenticated` user via the auto GraphQL API (RLS still limits *rows*, but the schema is visible). | Revoke `SELECT` from `authenticated` if discoverability is unwanted, or accept and document. |
| **P6-5** | 🟠 | **RLS init-plan perf** *(advisor 0003)* — both policies call `auth.uid()` per row instead of `(select auth.uid())` → slow at scale. | Rewrite policies to `(select auth.uid())`. Easy win. |
| **P6-6** | 🟡 | **Unindexed FK** *(advisor 0001)* — `revenue_events.user_id` has no covering index. | `create index on revenue_events(user_id)`. |
| **P6-7** | 🟡 | **`revenue_events` RLS-enabled, no policy** *(advisor 0008, INFO)* — intentional (service-role only), but flagged. | Acknowledge/document; no action needed. |
| **P6-8** | 🟠 | **Schema not in version control** — no migration files in the repo; the DB drifts independently of git, no reproducible setup. | Export migrations into the repo. |
| **P6-9** | 🟠 | **No staging/prod separation** — migrations (incl. via MCP) hit prod directly; a bad change has no buffer. | Add a staging project or branch DB. |
| **P6-10** | 🟡 | **`mammoth` unused dependency** — declared, imported nowhere. | Drop it, or wire up `.docx` parsing. |
| **P6-11** | 🟡 | **No documented data backup/restore** — `v1.0-stable` is a *code* tag, not a DB backup. | Confirm Supabase backup tier + a restore runbook. |
| **P6-12** | 🔵 | **Scale/infra not built** — connection pooling (Phase 3), CI/CD (manual deploy), SA data residency (Phase 4). | Expansion plan Phases 2–4. |
