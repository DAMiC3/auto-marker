# Category 4 — Error Handling (incl. Observability)

**Status:** ✅ Fully documented (extra-detailed) · **Last verified against code:** 2026-06-12
**Owner:** Michael Bernard

How the system behaves when things go wrong, and how we **see** that they went wrong. **Observability folds in here** — logging, exception tracking, dashboards, alerting. You can't handle what you can't see, so the two belong together.

This is a *cross-cutting* category: it doesn't own a feature, it owns the failure behaviour of every other category. The honest summary up front: **error handling is solid at the boundaries (clear+consistent status codes, retries on usage writes, isolated per-paper batch failures, correlation ids) and push alerting now exists (`notifyOps` → Bernard & CO on 500s, usage-write failures, and client errors) — but deeper observability is still thin (no searchable log history, no dashboard, no metrics).**

---

## 1. Philosophy (as implemented)

Three patterns recur across the codebase:

1. **Fail loud at the API boundary** — routes return specific HTTP codes (400/402/503) and a generic 500 fallback, never a silent success. The strongest example: a missing API key returns **503**, never a fake/mock mark (a deliberate "never stamp marks we didn't earn" rule).
2. **Fail open on infra, fail closed on logic** — when *metering infrastructure* hiccups, the instant route keeps marking (availability > strict enforcement); when the *allowance logic* says no, it blocks. (This is inconsistent between routes — see §7.)
3. **Swallow-and-continue on the client** — non-critical client operations (`listMemos`, `loadSavedRoot`, `AllowanceBar.refresh`) use `.catch(() => {})` so a single failure never white-screens the app. Good for resilience, bad for visibility.

---

## 2. HTTP status taxonomy (server routes)

| Code | Meaning | Where it's returned |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **400** | Bad input | no pages (`/api/mark`), no papers (`/api/mark/batch` POST), missing batch `id` (`batch` GET) |
| **402** | `allowance_exhausted` | cap hit / period expired / batch pre-flight overspend (both routes) |
| **500** | Generic server failure | outer `catch` in every route ("Marking failed", "Batch submission failed", "Batch retrieval failed") |
| **503** | AI not configured | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing (**all** routes — both POST **and** the batch GET, P4-4) |
| **redirect** | Auth gate | middleware → `/login`; auth callback → always a friendly page (`/auth/confirmed` / `/reset-password`), never a bare error URL (P3-9 / P4-5) |

> ✅ Missing-key handling is now **consistent**: 503 across all routes (was 400 in the batch GET — fixed P4-4, 2026-06-27).

---

## 3. Error handling, layer by layer

### 3.1 Instant route — `app/api/mark/route.ts`
- **Outer `try/catch`** → 500 + `console.error("Mark route error:", err)`.
- **Input guard** → 400 if no pages.
- **Key guard** → 503 if no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (explicit "No marks were applied").
- **Metering pre-check** now delegates to the shared **fail-CLOSED** gate `checkAllowance()` (Cat 1 §6.3, fixed P1-2/P4-2 2026-06-15). On any verification error (auth lookup or profile read) it returns `verification_failed` 503 and **blocks** marking — the old inner `try/catch … continuing` that yielded *free* marking is gone. Genuine backend failures also page ops (`notifyOps`).
- **Allowance block** → 402 (`allowance_exhausted`) / 401 (`not_authenticated`) / 503 (`verification_failed`), all from `checkAllowance()`.
- **Usage recording** → `recordUsage()` (retry-backed, §5.2); its failure does **not** fail the request (the mark already happened).

### 3.2 Batch route — `app/api/mark/batch/route.ts`
- **POST outer `try/catch`** → 500 "Batch submission failed."; **GET outer `try/catch`** → 500 "Batch retrieval failed."
- **`getUserId()`** (still used by the GET/recording path) has its own `try/catch` returning `null` on failure (so an auth hiccup ≠ crash).
- **POST pre-check now uses the shared fail-CLOSED gate** `checkAllowance()` (same as instant) — a verification error returns `verification_failed` 503 and blocks. The old instant/batch asymmetry (P4-2) is resolved.
- **Pre-flight overspend** → 402 with `{ detail, affordable }`.
- **GET per-paper isolation:** each result is `succeeded` → `parseMarkResponse` in a `try/catch` (→ `{error:"Could not parse marking result."}`) or non-succeeded → `{error:"Marking failed for this paper."}`. **One bad paper never kills the batch.** This is the most robust error handling in the app.

### 3.3 Marking libs
- **`lib/markingPrompt.ts` → `parseMarkResponse`** throws `"No JSON object found…"` when there are no braces; `JSON.parse` can also throw. In **batch** this is caught per-paper; in **instant** it bubbles to 500 (the whole paper fails).
- **`lib/cost.ts`** degrades gracefully: unknown model → Sonnet rates; every usage field `?? 0`. Cannot throw.
- **`lib/usage.ts`** → `isBlocked(null) = true` (fail closed); `recordUsage` retries (§5.2).
- **`lib/markPaper.ts` → `markInstant`** turns a non-OK response into `throw new Error(serverError ?? "Marking failed")`, surfacing the server's message to the UI. `preparePaper` has **no error handling** — pdf.js / canvas errors (corrupt PDF, OOM) propagate to the caller.

### 3.4 Client orchestration — `app/page.tsx`
- **`handleMark`** wraps the whole run: maps `allowance_exhausted` → friendly copy, otherwise shows the raw message; re-reads the From folder in the `catch`; `finally` clears busy/progress and fires `allowance-refresh`.
- **`pollBatch`** throws on a non-OK poll and throws `"Batch is taking longer than expected…"` after **240 attempts × 5 s ≈ 20 min**.
- **`handleConnect`** swallows the picker `AbortError` (user cancel) and surfaces other errors.
- **`handleAddMemo`** → `try/catch` → `setError`. **`listMemos` / `loadSavedRoot`** → silent `.catch(() => {})`.

### 3.5 Auth & middleware
- **`middleware.ts`** — if Supabase env is missing it **doesn't gate** (fail open). Otherwise it calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` and redirects. **`getUser()` is now wrapped in `try/catch`** (P4-1, 2026-06-27): a thrown lookup is logged and treated as no-user (fail closed), so an auth outage routes protected pages to `/login` rather than breaking the page load.
- **`app/auth/callback/route.ts`** — establishes the session (PKCE `code` or OTP `token_hash`) then forwards to a **friendly page, never a bare error URL** (P3-9 / P4-5): recovery → `/reset-password` (shows its own invalid/expired state), sign-up/confirmation → `/auth/confirmed` (always celebratory; on a failed exchange it appends `?signin=1` → "Sign in to start marking"). The old silent `?error=auth` redirect is gone.
- **`lib/supabase/server.ts`** — `setAll` is `try/catch`-guarded (Server Component cookie writes are safely ignored).

### 3.6 Storage (browser)
- **`loadSettings`** (`SettingsPanel.tsx`) → `try/catch` → returns `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (survives private mode / corrupt blob).
- **IndexedDB** (`memoArchive.ts`, `fileSystem.ts`) — promises reject on error; callers mostly `.catch(() => {})`. Permission-revoked file writes throw up into `handleMark`'s catch.

## 4. Failure-mode catalogue

The meaty part. **Trigger → current behaviour → gap → planned.**

| Trigger | Current behaviour | Gap | Planned (expansion plan) |
|---------|-------------------|-----|--------------------------|
| **Anthropic 429 (rate limit)** | Handled only by the **Anthropic SDK's built-in retry** (default ~2 retries on 429/5xx with backoff). Routes do **not** set `maxRetries` or add custom backoff. If retries exhaust → outer catch → 500 generic. | No explicit backoff, no queue, no "high demand, queued" UX. | Phase 4: explicit exponential backoff + Cloudflare Queues throttling |
| **Anthropic 5xx / outage** | SDK retries then throws → 500 "Marking failed. Check server logs." | No outage detection, no auto-requeue, user just sees a generic error | Phase 4: health-check cron + auto-retry |
| **Anthropic / Worker timeout** | `maxDuration = 60` (Cloudflare wall) hits before the SDK's long timeout on slow calls → 500 | Large/slow papers can't be retried gracefully | Phase 3: move heavy work off the request path (Queues) |
| **Malformed model JSON** | Batch: isolated per-paper `{error}`. Instant: bubbles → 500 (whole paper) | Instant has no per-paper salvage | — |
| **Corrupt / password-protected PDF** | `preparePaper` (pdf.js) throws → `handleMark` catch → raw error banner. **Instant: aborts the loop, leaving later papers unmarked.** Batch: aborts the prepare loop. | No pre-validation, no skip-and-continue, poor message | Phase 4: validate before queueing, skip bad files with a clear per-file error |
| **Browser OOM on large PDF** | Canvas render throws → same error path | No chunking; whole run fails | Phase 3: page-at-a-time processing |
| **Supabase down (pre-check)** | ✅ Both routes **fail CLOSED** via `checkAllowance()` → `verification_failed` 503, nothing marked, ops paged (P1-2, 2026-06-15) | Consistent; availability traded for no free marking | Resolved |
| **Supabase down (recordUsage)** | 3 retries → park in D1 dead-letter buffer → `notifyOps` → returns false; auto-drains on recovery (Problem 8) | Mark delivered but usage **not lost** — replayed later | Resolved |
| **Supabase auth down (middleware)** | ✅ `try/catch` around `getUser()` → logged, treated as no-user (fail closed) → protected pages route to `/login`, no page-load crash (P4-1, 2026-06-27) | Authenticated users get bounced to login during an outage (acceptable degradation) | Resolved |
| **Mid-batch allowance run-out** | Pre-flight estimate blocks an over-budget batch *before* submit; but a batch already in flight isn't stopped per-paper | No hard mid-run stop (estimate only) | Phase 4: partial-completion enforcement |
| **Batch poll > 20 min** | `pollBatch` throws "taking longer than expected — may still finish" | Result may be lost from the client's view | Phase 1/2: server-side batch tracking |
| **User closes tab mid-batch** | Poll loop dies; Anthropic batch still completes server-side but is **never retrieved/stamped** → work lost | No resumable jobs | Phase 1/2: server-side batch state + email on completion |
| **File permission revoked** | `writeFile`/`moveFile` throw → `handleMark` catch → banner | — | — |
| **localStorage/IndexedDB unavailable** | `loadSettings` → defaults; storage ops → silent catches | Memos/folder silently won't persist | — |

## 5. Retry & resilience mechanisms (what exists)

1. **Anthropic SDK default retries** — the only thing standing between a transient 429/5xx and a user-facing 500. *Not configured explicitly* in the routes; relies on SDK defaults. **If you want guaranteed behaviour, set `maxRetries` explicitly** when constructing `new Anthropic(...)`.
2. **`recordUsage()` retries** (`lib/usage.ts`) — 3 attempts, `250ms × attempt` backoff, per-attempt `try/catch`, checks the supabase-js `error` return (which the old code ignored), final `CRITICAL` log. Returns a boolean the callers currently **ignore**.
3. **Batch polling** — bounded retry loop (240 × 5 s) with a clear terminal error.
4. **Per-paper batch isolation** — one paper's failure is captured, not propagated.
5. **Config guards** as graceful degradation — see §6.

---

## 6. Graceful degradation (configuration guards)

The app is built to **run with pieces missing** rather than crash:

| Guard | Effect when env is absent |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `isServiceConfigured()` (`service.ts`) | No metering — marking proceeds unmetered (local dev) |
| `isSupabaseConfigured()` (`server.ts`/`client.ts`) | No auth gating; login shows "Sign-in isn't configured yet" |
| `middleware.ts` `!url \|\| !anonKey` | Skips the auth gate entirely |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` missing | 503 in routes (no fake marks) |

This is why local dev works without secrets — but it also means a **production env misconfiguration silently disables enforcement** rather than failing visibly. Worth a deploy-time assertion (see Category 6).

---

## 7. Known inconsistencies & bugs (error-handling specific)

1. ~~**Pre-check asymmetry**~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED (P1-2, 2026-06-15).** Both routes now share the fail-CLOSED `checkAllowance()` gate (Cat 1 §6.3): any verification error blocks marking (`verification_failed` 503) and pages ops; the old instant-route fail-open path is gone.
2. ~~**Status-code mismatch**~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED (P4-4, 2026-06-27).** Missing key is now 503 in the batch GET route too, matching both POST routes.
3. ~~**Silent auth-callback failure**~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED (P4-5, P3-9).** The callback no longer emits `?error=auth`; it always lands on a friendly page (`/auth/confirmed` or `/reset-password`). The only residual item — a **"resend confirmation" UI** for a user who never clicked the link — is a *new feature*, tracked in Category 7 (P7-6) alongside the P7-1 onboarding work, not here.
4. ~~**Middleware has no `try/catch`** around `getUser()`~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED (P4-1, 2026-06-27).** A thrown lookup is now logged and treated as no-user (fail closed), so an auth outage routes protected pages to `/login` instead of breaking page loads.
5. ~~**`recordUsage` boolean is ignored**~~ — ✅ **RESOLVED (P4-3, 2026-06-27).** A failed write retries → parks in the D1 dead-letter buffer → replays on the next good write → **and** pages ops via `notifyOps` (live: `OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is set). The batch route already used the boolean to stop its chunk loop; instant discards it but self-heals via the buffer.
6. **Instant-mode loop abort** — a single bad paper aborts the remaining papers (batch handles this correctly; instant does not).

---

## 8. Observability — current vs planned

### 8.1 Current state (thin)
- **Logging:** `console.error` / `console.log` only, scattered across routes and `recordUsage`. **Cloudflare Workers observability is enabled** (`observability.enabled: true` in `wrangler.jsonc` — Cat 6 §6), so logs surface in the dashboard live tail **and** are retained there. But they are **not externally aggregated, searchable across time, or alerted** — no Sentry, no Logpush sink, no thresholds.
- **Active alerting now exists** via `notifyOps` → `OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (the ntfy **"Bernard & CO"** app, secret confirmed set 2026-06-27): it pushes (a) usage-write failures, (b) allowance-verification failures, (c) client-reported errors (`/api/report-error`), and (d) **route 500s** from the instant + batch routes, each tagged with a correlation `rid` (P4-6/P4-8, 2026-06-27). This is real push-to-phone alerting, not just a console line.
- **Still missing:** no exception tracking (Sentry), **no** Logpush sink (searchable history), **no** uptime/health monitoring, **no** admin dashboard, **no** metrics (error rate, latency, active users, daily spend), **no** cron drain of the D1 dead-letter buffer.
- **Consequence:** you now get *pinged* when a request fails, but you still can't *browse* failures over time or see aggregate health — that's the remaining P4-8 work.

### 8.2 Planned (expansion plan Phases 2 & 4)
- **Sentry** (free tier) for exception tracking in the Next.js app.
- **Cloudflare Logpush** → a durable sink (Baselime/Axiom/dashboard) for searchable Worker logs.
- **Admin error dashboard** — a protected Next.js page querying Supabase: failed jobs (24h), current Anthropic error rate, active users, usage today. (Cheapest first step; needs the `batch_jobs` table from the expansion plan.)
- **Anthropic health-check cron** — ping every ~5 min, auto-retry failed jobs when the service recovers.
- **Alerting** — route `CRITICAL` usage-recording failures and dead-letter jobs to email (`bernardmanne3@gmail.com`) / Resend.

---

## 9. Invariants — do not break these

1. **Never return a successful mark you didn't make.** Missing key → 503, never a mock (the `mockResult` function stays dead — Cat 2 §4).
2. **A usage-write failure must be loud.** Keep the `recordUsage` retries + `CRITICAL` log; don't revert to silent `await rpc(...)`.
3. **One bad paper must not fail a whole batch.** Preserve the per-paper `try/catch` in the batch GET.
4. **Decide and document the pre-check policy** (open vs closed) and apply it *consistently* across both routes.
5. **Client resilience swallows are fine for non-critical reads only** — never swallow a write that affects billing or data integrity.

## Problems / To-Fix Backlog

> Severity: 🔴 fix before real paying customers · 🟠 important · 🟡 minor/polish · 🔵 not-built/roadmap.

| ID | Sev | Problem | Fix direction |
|----|-----|---------|---------------|
| ~~**P4-1**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-27).** Middleware now wraps `getUser()` in try/catch; a thrown lookup (auth outage) is treated as no-user (fail closed) and logged, so protected pages route to `/login` instead of crashing the page load. (= P7-5) | Done. |
| ~~**P4-2**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-15).** Pre-check policy asymmetry — both routes now share the fail-CLOSED `checkAllowance()` gate (Cat 1 §6.3); verification errors block marking + page ops. (= P1-2) | Done. |
| ~~**P4-3**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-06-27).** Stale row — predated the dead-letter system. A failed `recordUsage` already retries 3× → parks durably in D1 → replays on the next good write → **and pages ops via `notifyOps`** (`OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is set → Bernard & CO). Usage is deferred, not lost, and the failure is alerted. Residual nice-to-have: a cron drain (today the replay is opportunistic) — tracked under P4-8. | Done (alerting live). |
| ~~**P4-4**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-27).** Missing key now returns **503** in the batch GET route too (was 400), matching both POST routes. | Done. |
| ~~**P4-5**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **RESOLVED (P3-9).** The auth callback no longer emits `?error=auth` — it always lands on a friendly page (`/auth/confirmed` / `/reset-password`). The residual **"resend confirmation" UI** is a new feature, owned by Category 7 (P7-6), not an error-handling fix. | Done here; resend tracked in Cat 7. |
| ~~**P4-6**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-27).** Each route generates a short `rid` (`lib/requestId.ts`); it's logged on the 500 line **and** returned as `ref` in the error body, surfaced to the user as `(ref: …)` so they can quote it. | Done. |
| ~~**P4-7**~~ | 🟢 | ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-27).** `lib/withTimeout.ts` caps every Supabase round-trip at 8 s (auth `getUser`, profile read, `add_usage`, middleware + batch auth). A hung call now fails fast into the existing fail-closed paths instead of riding to the 60 s wall. | Done. |
| **P4-8** | 🟠 | **Observability — wire server errors to Bernard & CO.** `notifyOps` (→ `OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`, the ntfy "Bernard & CO" app) now also receives the route **500s** (instant + batch POST/GET), tagged with the `rid`. **Still open:** no admin dashboard, no Logpush sink, no cron drain of the D1 dead-letter buffer, no metrics (error rate / latency / daily spend). | Build the admin page + Logpush + dead-letter drain cron (Phase 2/4). |

## 10. Key files (quick reference)

| File | Error-handling role |
|------|---------------------|
| `app/api/mark/route.ts` | Instant: 400/402/401/503/500; **fail-closed** `checkAllowance()` gate; retry-backed recording |
| `app/api/mark/batch/route.ts` | Batch: per-paper isolation, pre-flight 402, **fail-closed** `checkAllowance()` gate (POST) |
| `lib/usage.ts` | `checkAllowance` (fail-closed gate + ops page), `isBlocked` (fail-closed), `recordUsage` (retries → D1 dead-letter + ops page) |
| `lib/markingPrompt.ts` | `parseMarkResponse` throws on no-JSON |
| `lib/markPaper.ts` | `markInstant` surfaces server errors; `preparePaper` unguarded |
| `app/page.tsx` | `handleMark` catch + friendly mapping; bounded `pollBatch` |
| `middleware.ts` | Auth gate; `getUser()` wrapped in try/catch → fail closed to `/login` on auth outage (P4-1) |
| `app/auth/callback/route.ts` | Code/OTP exchange → friendly landing page, never a bare error URL (P3-9 / P4-5) |
| `lib/supabase/{server,client,service}.ts` | Config guards = graceful degradation |
| `lib/requestId.ts` | `newRequestId()` — short correlation id in logs + `ref` in 500 bodies (P4-6) |
| `lib/withTimeout.ts` | `withTimeout()` — 8 s cap on Supabase round-trips so a hang fails fast, not at the 60 s wall (P4-7) |
| `lib/notify.ts` | `notifyOps()` → `OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (Bernard & CO); now also receives route 500s (P4-8) |
